/*:
 **Task**: Create an even grid on the `canvas`, made out of squares that each are one third as wide and one third as high as the `canvas`.Use the same colors as in the picture (they are already defined for you above in the `colors` array):
 
 ![Challenge 4](./challenge4.png "Challenge 4")
 
 1. Implement above task by setting the views' `frame`s directly.
 2. Implement above task by defining _AutoLayout_ constraints programmatically.
 
 (Make sure to comment out the first implementation once you start working on the second one to avoid confusion.)
