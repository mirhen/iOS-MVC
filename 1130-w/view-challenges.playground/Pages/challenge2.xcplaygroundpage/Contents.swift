/*:
 **Task**: Add three `UIView`s to the `canvas`. Each of these views should be square and have a third of the `canvas`' `width` and `height`. 
 
 
 ![Challenge 2](./challenge2.png "Challenge 2")
 
 1. Implement above task by setting the views' `frame`s directly.
 2. Implement above task by defining _AutoLayout_ constraints programmatically.
 
 (Make sure to comment out the first implementation once you start working on the second one to avoid confusion.)
