# Mastering UIKit

Today, we are going to look at UIKit's major component: `UIView`. In particular, we want to understand sizing and positioning.

There are four video lectures you should watch before starting to work on the challenges:

- [1-slides](https://youtu.be/t_lmUi_E-70) & [2-slides](https://youtu.be/3GPnG5jsKS8) contain a short intro using [slides](https://github.com/MakeSchool-18/iOS-MVC/blob/master/1130-w/slides.pdf) (which are also contained in today's materials)
- [3-playground-demo](https://youtu.be/DrLp0yKqCL4) illustrates the example from the slides in an Xcode playground (the result of this video is also contained in this directory: [UIKit-demo.playground](https://github.com/MakeSchool-18/iOS-MVC/tree/master/1130-w/UIKit-demo.playground))
- [4-sample-solution](https://youtu.be/7EZ0dBL_4V0) explains what to do in the challenges and demonstrates an example
