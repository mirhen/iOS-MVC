# AutoLayout

After learning about how to create `UIView`s programatically and sizing and positioning them through _directly manipulating_ their `frame`s in code, we now want to learn how to use AutoLayout which gives us much more power to create our user interfaces, especially with regard to scaling to different screen sizes.

Please work on the second task on the [Playground](https://github.com/MakeSchool-18/iOS-MVC/tree/master/1130-w/view-challenges.playground) pages from Wednesday. Here, you are doing the same thing as you did on Wednesday, except that now you are configuring the views on the canvas by specifying AutoLayout constraint rather than setting the `frame` values.

Use the following materials as a reference:
- [1 - Introduction to AutoLayout (Programmatically) (1/2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYqaVQlKT0A) and [2 - Introduction to AutoLayout (Programmatically) (2/2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdzjCEl3ATg) contain a short intro using [slides](https://github.com/MakeSchool-18/iOS-MVC/blob/master/1202-f/slides.pdf)
- [3 - Sample Solution for Playground Challenge (1/3)](https://youtu.be/La6bzfrrBJE), [4 - Sample Solution for Playground Challenge (2/3)](https://youtu.be/0HrtnCkhOfU) and [5 - Sample Solution for Playground Challenge (3/3)](https://youtu.be/IaXmZiRoeOg) explain how to solve the example challenge in the Playground
- [6 - Visual Explanation of Sample Solution for Playground Challenge (Interface Builder) (1/2)](https://youtu.be/mt_ckfvd2dI) and [7 - Visual Explanation of Sample Solution for Playground Challenge (Interface Builder) (2/2)](https://youtu.be/B-WxvLJzHqk) give a visual explanation of what was done in the previous three videos in code; these videos are **optional** and solely serve to increase your understanding of AutoLayout, but they're not required to solve the Playground challenges
